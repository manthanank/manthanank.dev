## Overview

The "Learn Angular" project is a curated repository designed to help developers master Angular from the basics to advanced concepts. It provides a structured learning path with practical examples and real-world scenarios.

## Features

- **Component Architecture**: Deep dives into standalone components and nested structures.
- **State Management**: Examples using RxJS and NgRx for scalable state handling.
- **Directives & Pipes**: Custom implementations to extend template functionality.
- **Testing**: Unit and integration testing patterns with Jasmine and Karma.

## The Challenge

Angular can have a steep learning curve due to its opinionated structure. This project aims to bridge the gap by providing clear, maintainable code snippets that follow the latest community standards.

## Results

Since its launch, the repository has helped dozens of developers understand modern Angular 17+ patterns, including the new control flow syntax and Signals.
